                    Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites 
                    and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
                    <br />
                    Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). 
                    <br />
                    The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
